## quick_planning_db_fields_for_people_at_meetups

1) usually ask about websites they want to emulate and gain screenshots for website.
2) from the resulting wireframes write down all possible fields 
3) including duplicate fields for things like username if multiple wireframes share those field names.
4) put all of this into an excel file in a flat structure without associations and without defined relationships.
5) start putting the types to the values provided.
6) now time to create the tables it should be easier to create the database structure when looking at the filed written.
7) if still finding difficulty atleast you wrote the fields down and took your next step forward.
